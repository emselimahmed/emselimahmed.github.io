            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-text">After acquiring a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, I am now capable of crafting
                simple websites with ease. My confidence has grown to the extent that I can even teach my grandmother
                how to create her own basic website. However, I am eager to embark on a journey of advancement. My
                immediate goal is to build three websites, using them as a platform to explore more complex concepts. I
                plan to delve into JavaScript for interactive elements, responsive web design for optimal user
                experiences, CSS frameworks for streamlined development, and server-side programming languages to create
                dynamic functionality. Through these pursuits, I aim to become a well-rounded web developer, ready for
                more challenging projects.</p>
